This is the current codebase for DWiki, my Python based wiki-oid engine
that I use for my techblog Wandering Thoughts (among other things),
http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/

It is not a completely useful or documented codebase at the moment.

Bits:
- test: hierarchy of basic templates, pages, and so on for testing. It's
  also served as the base set of files for my production uses of DWiki.
  test/pages/dwiki/ contains various documentation on DWiki's operation.

- wiki.conf: sample / example / testing configuration file
  See test/pages/dwiki/ConfigurationFile

- dwiki-serv.py: serve DWiki using Python's built in web server code.
  Suitable only for testing.

- dwiki-cgi.py: run DWiki as a CGI.
- dwiki-scgi.py: SCGI-based frontend for DWiki. Its usage is complex,
  see -h/--help. It communicates with your web server (or SCGI client)
  over a Unix domain socket.

- dwiki-cat.py: a relatively raw rendering interface for DWiki.
  Mostly suitable for examining the internals and dumping raw pages.

- dpasswd.py: add entries to a DWiki password file. Has bugs about
  in-place updates, which should be fixed.

- testbench.py: a timing and profiling test harness. Using statprof
  requires some external assistance beyond the scope of this README.

All four DWiki frontends take a common core of options (in addition
to some options specific to each frontend) and expect to be given
a configuration file as their main argument. See the output of
the -h/--help option from each of them.

Note that timestamps of files in test/ matter. Since git doesn't
support file timestamps, there is a primitive shell script to save
and restore them to a file:

	./dostamps set test test.timestamps
		# restore test/* timestamps from test.timestamps data

	./dostamps get test test.timestamps
		# save test/* timestamps to test.timestamps

You need to do the former before starting to do stuff with DWiki.
You want to do the latter before commiting any new or changed files
in test/*.
