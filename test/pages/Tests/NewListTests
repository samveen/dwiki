= Some tests of new list formatting stuff.

* This should be a multiple paragraph entry.

  Continued just as is.
* This should be an entry.

* and another one, but with a <p> between.

Now we set up the bomb.

* one level.
  * two levels.
    that is continued.

    with a new paragraph!
  that is back to one level.
* and one level.
  * two levels.
    that is continued

  new paragraph in *one level*, not two level.

Let us start something sensible, in isolation.

* now, the tricky case of an indented thing that we should turn into a quote.
	Like so. This should be a quote.
		And more so.
	Like so mark 2.
	* this should be inside the blockquote. I think it won't be.

* and again:
	This is quoted

	Will this be? What *does* this come out as?

Final torture test, that is probably going to require some torturing:

* this is a list.

	This is a pre block, not a quotation.
