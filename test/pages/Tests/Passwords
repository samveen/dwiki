= Authentication demo logins/passwords

There's some demo logins that you can use to play around here.
They are: visitor1, visitor2, and visitor3. Each has a password
of their name. One and two are in the 'visitors' group, three is
in the 'tourists' and 'systems' group.

The following are some restricted-access pages that you can experiment
with:
{{AllPages:Tests/Restricted}}

Of course all of this only works if I have turned on authentication
in the server configuration. (You can tell by the presence of a
login or logout box at the bottom of this page.)
