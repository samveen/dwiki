= Testing slim tables.

|_. This is a start | and more. |
| This should continue | with more. |

And done.

Here's another example:

|_. 0		| Success.					| ABC
| 1		| Failure case A.				| DEF
| 2		| Failure case B.
| 3		| Failure case C, with a bunch of long text that I hope
		  will wind up forcing a linewrap so that I can see how
		  that comes out in real life, and so on and all that
		  and am I done yet? I should darnedly well be.	| GHI

End of table.
