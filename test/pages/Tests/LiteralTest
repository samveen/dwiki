== Test literals.
.pn lit x86_86 lit *foobar lit foobar*

This is a section of text with x86_86, *foobar, foobar*, and some random
things_with_underscores. More test: x85_86; x86_68. Also *Foobar things
with foobaR*.

Hmm. This is going to explode: *Starting *foobar italics foobar* ending*

Testing again: foobar*

More testing, for the global invalid_id setting and ~~not a bold~~.
Yet, ~~this is bold~~ and some of_this is typewriter_.

(Also, bonus ``literal text with *foobar* and some_id and so on
~~quoting~~ that should work, and have < and & and so on escaped''.)

Also: escaped !``literal text'' had better work.
