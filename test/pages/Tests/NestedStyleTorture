= Torture test cleverly nested style starts and ends.

This is a *perverse [[link end*it test _case_ example
http://www.google.com/]]. This will otherwise get unfortunate tag soup.

This is another *perverse {{ST:small:crazy end*it test, with _embedded_
fonts}}. This ditto.

Now we try harder, with *nesting*! To wit:

* a *test [[link _case with*it {{ST:small:with_ ending}} stuff
  http://www.google.com/]]. End text. \\
  Okay, macros don't render inside link text (not even _ST_).
* Try it *the {{ST:small:other way*: _inverted to an [[embedded_ link
  example http://www.google.com]], I think that should work?}} With end
  text.

Okay, this is wierd: _does this space_? \\
How about *this example*: _does it_?

All right: {{ST:big:big text with a : or two : in the middle of it}}.
And that's it.
