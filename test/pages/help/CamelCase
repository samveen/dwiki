= CamelCase and WikiWords

CamelCase is the general term DWiki uses for words run together with
each word having its start capitalized; CamelCase is itself a
CamelCase word.

DWiki uses CamelCase words in DWikiText as the easiest way of making
links between DWiki pages: a CamelCase word that's the name of another
DWiki page turns into a link to that other page. (The rules for
figuring out when a CamelCase word is 'the name of another DWiki page'
and what happens when it's possibly ambiguous are a little arcane;
they are discussed on the DWikiText page.)

Technically speaking, a DWiki CamelCase word has to start with a
capital letter and have another capital letter somewhere later in
it. Words can include alphabetic characters, numbers, '_/_', and
'_._'.

DWiki's CamelCase rules are a particular instance of the general Wiki
idea of WikiWords.
