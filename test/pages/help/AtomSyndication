= Atom syndication for DWiki changes

RSS and Atom feeds, also know as 'syndication', are a way of having a
special reader keep track of the latest news from some area of a web
site; RSS and Atom are different formats for the feed information. But
then, if you're reading this you probably already know all that.

DWiki provides Atom feeds for recently changed pages and recent
comments. It doesn't currently support RSS feeds, although it may in
the future. (Most feed readers should support Atom format feeds, and
if they don't they should be upgraded to do so.)

At the bottom of every page supporting Atom feeds, there is a 'Atom
Syndication' toolbar that has appropriate links. What they are feeds
for depends on what they are attached to:
* The 'Recent Pages' Atom feed is for recently changed pages under
  that directory.
* Thus, the 'Recent Pages' link on the [[DWiki root|/]] will
  give you a recently changed pages feed for the entire DWiki.
* The 'Recent Comments' on a page is for recent comments to
  that page; it only appears if the page allows comments.
* The 'Recent Comments' on a directory is for recent comments to any
  pages under that directory; on the [[DWiki root]], that is recent
  comments on any page in the DWiki.

Unless your feed reader is unusually featurefull, Atom feeds are
unauthenticated and so will not pick up any restricted content.  (To
pick up restricted content, the feed reader needs to give the DWiki
server a valid authentication cookie.)
