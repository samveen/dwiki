= Directories in DWiki

DWiki encourages you to use directories to group DWiki pages together
and to organize your DWiki's hierarchy of information. (Besides, since
you're editing pages in Unix they're convenient for keeping the output
of _ls_ commands to a reasonable size.)

Unlike normal pages, directories clearly don't have ordinary text of
their own to display. Instead, DWiki offers several 'views' of a
directory's contents:
* the *normal* view just lists the directory's pages and
  subdirectories in a big list, sorted alphabetically.
* the *blogdir* view is a 'changelog' style display of every page in
  the directory, most recent to oldest.
* the *blog* view is like the *blogdir* view, except that it shows all
  pages under the directory (including pages in subdirectories), but
  only the first so many of them, and then provides a number of tools
  to navigate around all of these pages.

You can switch to different views of a directory by using the
appropriate links in the Page Tools menu at the bottom of a
directory's page.

== Setting the default view for a directory

Directories normally default to being viewed in the normal view
(that's why it's called that). However, if a file called
_.flag.prefview:~~<view>~~_ exists in a directory, that view becomes
the default view instead.

If you make two or more files like that for different views, what
happens is undefined. (Okay, DWiki picks one using arcane internal
rules.)

== Directory 'readme' files

If you create a file called ((__readme)) in a directory, it will be
shown at the start of the text in the 'blog' and 'blogdir' views.

== Directory-wide default permissions

You can set up default access permissions and commentability for
everything under a directory by creating a file called ((__access)) in
the directory and putting in appropriate _CanComment_ and _Restricted_
macros.

When it checks permissions, DWiki starts at the page and walks
backwards up the directory hierarchy until it has to give up; the
first [[__access|]] file that has something to say about the thing in
question (page access or commentability) is the one that wins.

This means that [[__access|]] files lower in the directory hierarchy
can give back access to things that a higher level took away. This is
deliberate, but please be aware of it.
