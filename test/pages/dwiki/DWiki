= Hello, I am a DWiki

DWiki stands for 'Dinky Wiki', which is what [[/People/ChrisSiebenmann]]
calls this for lack of a better name. As far as Chris knows on a casual
scan, 'DWiki' is not being used as the name of any other Wiki software.

I ([[/People/ChrisSiebenmann]]) wrote DWiki to have a good environment
for writing documentation about how we do system administration work
on our Unix systems. You can see a bigger list of [[Features]] if you
want.

DWiki's design choices are very slanted towards making it as easy as
possible for us to write, revise, and maintain system
documentation. (Because on past evidence, it if isn't dirt easy we
just aren't going to do it.)

I like WikiText, because it is a simple, low-effort way to write
documentation that comes out looking decent. But I don't like the wiki
interface for writing it: web browsers make crappy editing
environments and limit the sort of changes you can easily do. So I
wrote DWiki to have a good system for displaying wikitext that we'd
write through other means.

== Wiki or CMS?

Some people say (strongly) that DWiki is not a Wiki because people
(currently) can't edit DWiki pages over the web; they argue that
instead it should be called a CMS (a (web) Content Management System).

I'm willing to accept this argument in theory, but ...

I like punchy, usefully descriptive names. My personal opinion is that
'wiki' is one: calling DWiki a wiki tells you a great deal about it,
while calling it a CMS tells you almost nothing.

So while I may be willing to accept the argument, DWiki stays being
called a wiki (and keeps the 'Wiki' in the name).

I maintain web-based editing makes little sense for us, and wrote a
bunch about why in WhyNotWebEditing.

And one can always have a big debate over at the granddaddy Wiki,
at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiPrinciples.
