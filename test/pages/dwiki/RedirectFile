= Redirection Files

Files in the page directory can create HTTP redirections, making it
trivial to support plurals, moved/renamed pages, and so on. There are
two ways of doing it: _REDIRECT_ content and symbolic links.

If a file starts with a line that says '_REDIRECT *somewhere*_', and
does not have more than a few lines of content, DWiki considers it a
redirection. The *somewhere* is basically interpreted as if it was
appearing in a _![[....]]_, so it can be:
* redirection to another DWiki page.
* redirection to an external web site, written as _!http://...._
* redirection to an absolute URL on this web site, written as
  _<...>_
These files are generically called REDIRECT files.

A symbolic link is only considered a redirect if DWiki can 'resolve'
it into an existing page. To resolve the symbolic link redirect, DWiki
tries to interpret the symbolic link's value as if it was appearing in
a _![[...]]_ as a DWiki relative page name.

If the symbolic link doesn't resolve this way, DWiki treats the whole
thing as an ordinary page; this keeps 'ordinary' uses of symlinks
intact in most cases, including when the symlinks point to something
outside the DWiki page directory.

Redirects to http:// links or absolute URL links are a convenient way
of creating WikiWord abbreviations to external things for local
use. Make an appropriate REDIRECT file, stick it in your Aliases area,
and now every page in the DWiki can say GoogleSearch or something and
get a link, bam.

(WikiWord redirection rewriting means that in many cases the generated
link will even point to the real target instead of the REDIRECT file,
as you can see here.)
