= Virtual Directories in DWiki

A virtual directory is a way of restricting what pages get shown out
of a real directory. It works by tacking on 'virtual' directories
after the real directory (ie, as subdirectories) to tell DWiki what
you want to see.

Virtual directories restrict pages based on their most recent
modification time. There are three versions available:

* *calendar*: with the format ((<year>/[<month>/[<day>]])), all as
  digits. Only pages most recently changed in the time period get
  selected.
* *latest*: with the format _latest/<howmany>_. They show just the
  most recently changed _<howmany>_ pages.
* *oldest*: with the format _oldest/<howmany>_. They show just the
  least recently changed _<howmany>_ pages.
* *range*: with the format _range/<start>-<end>_. They show the
  start'th to the end'th most recently changed page.

All pieces of a virtual directory must really *be* virtual. If you
have a directory _Foo/_ with a _Foo/2005/_ subdirectory (or file), you
cannot use the virtual directory _Foo/2005/05/_ to see things from May
of 2005 in _Foo/_. Moral: let DWiki organize things based on time for
you, don't do it yourself.

Virtual directories are paid attention to by some renderers, which are
generally used in some views. You can get the full list in
TemplateSyntax.
