= DWiki's configuration file

DWiki's configuration file has a simple format. Blank lines and
comments (any line that has a '_#_' as the first non-whitespace
character) are just skipped, and everything else is interpreted as a
configuration directive to set.

Configuration directives have optional values, which are separated
from the configuration item by whitespace. (Whitespace within the
value is not interpreted, although trailing whitespace is removed from
lines.)

So an example set of configuration file lines might be:
 root		/web/data/dwiki
 pagedir		pages
 tmpldir		templates
 wikiname	TestWiki
 wikititle	Testing Wiki

DWiki requires and uses some configuration directives. Unused
configuration directives are not errors; all configuration directives
(and their values) become part of the context variables available for
template _${...}_ expansion.

To simplify life, configuration directives are put through a
canonicalization process. This operates like so:

* if ~~root~~ is specified, it must be an absolute path to a directory.
* if something ending in ~~dir~~ or ~~file~~ is not an absolute path and
  ~~root~~ is defined, DWiki sees if tacking on ~~root~~ results in the
  right sort of thing.
* any directive ending in ~~dir~~ or ~~file~~ must wind up (possibly after the
  ~~root~~ prefixing above) being an absolute path to a directory or a
  file respectively.
* if ~~root~~ is defined and ~~pagedir~~, ~~tmpldir~~, or ~~rcsdir~~ are not
  defined, DWiki sees if directories called _pages_, _templates_, or
  _rcsroot_ exist under ~~root~~ and if so sets up the configuration
  directives appropriately.

Required configuration directives are: _pagedir_, _tmpldir_,
_wikiname_, and _rooturl_. This means that with defaulting, the
minimal DWiki configuration file is:
>  root	/some/where
>  rooturl /some/thing
>  wikiname SomeThing

== Configuration directives and their meanings:

=== Core where-to-find-things configuration:
- _root_: If present, this is taken as the root directory that
  further configuration directives can specify paths relative to.
- _pagedir_: The root directory of the page hierarchy. (Required.)
- _tmpldir_: The root directory of the template hierarchy. (Required;
  cannot be the same as _pagedir_.)
- _usercs_: Support checking RCS files for things like page history,
  page locker, and so on. (Whether or not _usercs_ is set, DWiki
  refuses to serve files ending with _,v_ or in RCS directories; see
  InvalidPageNames.)
- _rcsroot_: The root directory of the separate RCS file storage
  hierarchy; used only if _usercs_ is on. \\
  Normally, RCS files are expected to be in _RCS_ directories under
  _pagedir_, where basic RCS commands put them (if you make those
  directories; DWiki requires you to work this way). With this
  directive on, the RCS _,v_ files for files
  under _pagedir_ are instead found under here, in a mirror of the
  directory structure in _pagedir_, so you have *pagedir*_/foo/bar_
  and *rcsdir*_/foo/bar,v_. This keeps _pagedir_ neater at the expense
  of requiring some scripting support.

=== Web configuration
- _wikiname_: The short, one-word name of this DWiki. You probably
  want to have a CamelCased name. This shows up as the name of the
  breadcrumbs, among other places. (Required.)
- _wikititle_: The full, multi-word title of this DWiki.
- _wikiroot_: The front page of the DWiki; the page you get redirected
  to when you request the DWiki's root. If this isn't set or doesn't
  exist, DWiki tries _wikiname_'s value as a page name; if that
  doesn't work, people see the DWiki's root directory in a directory
  view.
- _rooturl_: The URL of the directory that is the root of the DWiki
  instance; use '/' to mean 'the root of the web server'.
- _publicurl_: If set, DWiki puts this directory's URL on the front of
  DWiki URLs instead of _rooturl_.
- _staticdir_: The directory to serve static files from. DWiki *only
  serves files* from this hierarchy; requests for a directory will fail.
- _staticurl_: The URL of the directory that is the root of static
  files. If _staticurl_ doesn't start with a slash, it's taken as a
  subdirectory of _rooturl_. (Requires _staticdir_ to be set.)
- _charset_: If set, DWiki claims that all text/html and text/plain
  content it generates is in this character set in HTTP
  replies. Normally 'UTF-8' these days. If unset, DWiki does not label
  text/html and text/plain HTTP replies with character set information.

==== DWiki URL to file mapping

When DWiki gets a request for a URL, it tries to turn it into a
request for something under either _staticurl_ (if defined) or
_rooturl_; whatever is left after subtracting the appropriate thing is
the path being served relative to _staticdir_ or _pagedir_.
_staticurl_ is checked first, so it can be a subset of the URL space
available under _rooturl_.

For safety reasons, DWiki only tries to process a request if the
request's URL falls under either _staticurl_ or _rooturl_. If DWiki
receives a request for anything outside those two, something is
clearly wrong and it generates a terse error page.

When it generates URLs for DWiki pages DWiki normally puts _rooturl_
on front (as a directory). However, if you set _publicurl_ DWiki puts
that on the front instead.

This is useful if for internal reasons you receive requests with their
URLs rewritten to something users shouldn't (or can't) use.  The case
ChrisSiebenmann knows is Apache with URL aliases and the DWiki CGI-BIN
being run via suexec.

=== Authentication
- _authfile_: Where DWiki can find user / password / group information
  for the DWiki's users. If this is set, the DWiki has authentication.
- _defaultuser_: If set, all otherwise not authenticated connections
  get to be this user, *if* the user is in _authfile_. This should be
  used carefully, as it makes *all* requests to the DWiki be
  authenticated (since they all have a user, if even only the default
  user).
- _global-authseed_: This is a special magic token to make it harder
  to brute-force people's DWiki passwords in some situations. It can
  be any value and should be kept secret.
- _global-authseed-file_: This is the file to read _global-authseed_
  from, if it is set. The file has no special format, but should
  contain some randomness and its contents should be kept secret.
- _authcookie-path_: This controls the 'path=' value for the
  authentication cookies generated by DWiki. If not set to a value, we
  use the root URL; otherwise we use the value straight. If it is not
  set, authentication cookes have no explicit 'path='
  setting. ChrisSiebenmann has come to believe that you don't want to
  set this, and it remains as a vestigial remnant.

=== Comments
- _commentsdir_: The root directory for storing comments in. The only
  place DWiki writes to.
- _comments-on_: Enable commenting in this DWiki. This requires that
  _commentsdir_ be defined and that authentication be enabled.
- _comments-in-normal_: Your standard templates display comments on
  the normal view of the page instead of the 'showcomments' view.
- _remap-normal-to-showcomments_: DWiki will remap the 'normal' view
  for pages to the 'showcomments' view, thereby implementing
  _comments-in-normal_ without you needing to change the standard
  templates.

=== Caching

DWiki can optionally cache the results of page generation to speed
up response time. See [[Caching]] for a longer discussion.

- _cachedir_: The root directory for storing the caches.
- _cache-warn-errors_: Log warnings about cache store errors. (These
  are non-fatal but indicate that your cache isn't caching.)
- _render-cache_: Enable caching the results of selected renderers and
  renderer components. (Requires _cachedir_ to be set.)
- _render-heuristic-ttl_: The TTL of renderer cache entries with
  heuristic validators.
- _render-anonymous-only_: Use the render cache only for the guest
  user or for connections that are not authenticated.
- _bfc-cache-ttl_: Enable a brute force page cache of complete pages
  with a TTL of this many seconds. (Requires _cachedir_ to be set.)
- _bfc-time-min_: A complete page will be cached if it took at least
  this much of a second to be generated. Defaults to 0.75 of a second.
- _bfc-load-min_: A complete page will be cached if the load average
  is at least this high. No default; the BFC normally doesn't look at
  the load average at all.
- _bfc-time-triv_: Regardless of the setting of _bfc-load-min_, don't
  bother looking at the load average if the page took at most this
  long to generate. Defaults to 0.09 of a second.
- _bfc-atom-ttl_: Use this TTL for Atom syndication requests, instead
  of the normal one.
- _bfc-atom-nocond-ttl_: Use this TTL for Atom syndication requests
  that are not using conditional GET, and also force the caching
  of the results of these requests regardless of the load.
- _bfc-skip-robots_: If set, this is a list of User-Agent substrings
  (formatted as for _bad-robots_, see later) for robots that should
  not cause entries to be put into the BFC.
- _imc-cache-entries_: Enable an in-memory cache of complete pages with
  this many entries. Only meaningful when DWiki is running as a preforking
  SCGI server. The IMC skips all pages that the BFC skips.
- _imc-cache-ttl_: The TTL, in seconds, of entries in the in-memory cache;
  must be provided if _imc-cache-entries_ is.
- _imc-resp-max-size_: The maximum size (in kilobytes) of pages that will
  be cached in the in-memory cache. The default value is 256 KB.
- _slow-requests-by_: Delay all requests by this much,
  in fractional seconds. Normally used only for testing BFC.

=== Syndication feed controls

- _atomfeed-display-howmany_: How many items at most an Atom feed
  should display. If set, it must be a positive integer; if not set,
  _atom::pages_ and _atom::comments_ use a default.
- _feed-max-size_: How many kilobytes _atom::pages_ or
  _atom::comments_ should try to limit their output to. If set, either
  stops adding new entries (regardless of how many entries have been
  processed already) once they have generated that many kilobytes or
  more of output. Because of the 'or more' clause, you should allow
  for a safety margin. If unset, syndication feeds are not
  size-limited.
- _feed-max-size-ips_: If set, this is a whitespace separated list of
  IP addresses, tcpwrappers style IP address prefixes (eg
  '_66.150.15._'), or IP CIDRs (eg '_66.150.15.0/25_') that
  _feed-max-size_ applies to. Syndication requests from any other
  addresses are not size-limited. If unset, _feed-max-size_ applies to all
  syndication requests, regardless of what IP address makes the request.
  This option can be specified multiple times; if so, all the addresses
  are merged together.
- _feed-start-time_: If set, pages older than this time will not
  appear in Atom feeds, which is handy if you want to move a
  DWiki, redirect the old URLs, and not flood people's Atom feeds
  (because the Atom <id> for pages is the page's full URL).
  The value can be specified either as an integer Unix timestamp,
  as 'YEAR-MO-DA [HH:MM[:SS]]', 'YEAR/MO/DA', or an Atom format time
  string, and is always in *local* time (even when specified as an
  Atom format time string; sorry).
- _atomfeed-tag_: If set, the _atom::pagetag_ renderer will use it
  to  generate Atom <id>s for pages in the format <tag>:/<page path>.
  This should normally be set to a _tag:_-based URI; see
  [[here http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id]]
  for a discussion.
- _atomfeed-tag-time_: If set, the _atom::pagetag_ renderer will only
  generate tag-formatted Atom <id>s for pages more recent than this
  time. This can be used to make a graceful transition into
  tag-based Atom <id>s for an existing DWiki (and then, with
  _feed-start-time_, to graceful move it). This has the same time
  format as _feed-start-time_.

=== Other features:
- _alias-path_: This sets the DWiki path for the third place to try to
  find CamelCase links in (see [[Formatting]]). This allows a DWiki to
  have a collection of CamelCase names for things that are globally
  usable but that don't clutter up the DWiki root directory. \\
  This is a *DWiki* path, not a filesystem path (and is implicitly
  always an absolute DWiki path). The conventional value is _Aliases_.
- _search-on_: enables searching. If it has the value 'authenticated',
   only authenticated users can search.
- _blog-display-howmany_: How many items the _blog::blog_ renderer
  should try to restrict most pages it displays to. If set, it must be
  a positive integer; if not set, _blog::blog_ uses a default.
- _canon-hosts_: If set, this is a space-separated list of canonical
  hostnames for this DWiki. If a request has a _Host:_ header that is
  not in this list, DWiki immediately serves up a redirection to the
  first hostname in the list, which is assumed to be the preferred
  hostname.
- _literal-words_: If set, this is a list of strings, separated by
  '_ | _' (space, |, space), that will be rendered literally and not
  considered to contain markup, as if each of them had been specified
  in '_.pn lit <whatever>_' processing note directives.

=== Dealing with bad clients:
- _bad-robots_: If set, this is a list of User-Agent substrings,
  separated by '_ | _' (space, |, space), for robots that should get
  permission denied responses when they try to fetch pages in various
  views that no robot should be fetching.  Currently the list of bad
  views is atom, atomcomments, source, and writecomment, all of which
  are typically fetched by robots that don't respect _rel="nofollow"_
  on links.
- _no-ua-is-bad-robot_: If set, any request with a missing User-Agent header
  is considered to be from a bad robot.
- _banned-robots_: If set, this is a list of User-Agent substrings
  (formatted as for _bad-robots_) for robots that should get permission
  denied responses on *all* requests.
- _banned-ips_: If set, this is a list of IP addresses, tcpwrapper
  style IP prefixes, or CIDRs (as for _feed-max-size-ips_) for addresses
  that will get access denied responses for all requests. It can be
  specified multiple times.
- _banned-comment-ips_: If set, this is like _banned-ips_ but only applies
  to attempts to write comments.
