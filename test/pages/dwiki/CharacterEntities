= Character entity names recognized by DWiki

This is the automatically generated big list of character entities
recognized by (this) DWiki in the _C_ macro. For the meanings and more
precise specifications of these, see the [[Character entity references
in HTML 4 http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html]] from the
[[HTML 4.01 http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/]] specification.

Note that not everything in this list may show as a character in your
browser, or in other people's browsers. Also, this list is pretty much
the full HTML 4.01 list. Older versions of HTML don't define all of
these entities; the [[Wikipedia page
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references]]
is the best reference for what entities are defined in what version of
HTML. (Since DWiki doesn't know what HTML version you're labelling its
output as, it can't restrict the entities _C_ will accept.)

Some tedious but possibly important detail: DWiki takes its list of
known character entities from the Python [[htmlentitydefs module
http://docs.python.org/lib/module-htmlentitydefs.html]].
