DWiki can now restrict what sorts of VirtualDirs advertise
AtomFeeds (both in SyndicationDiscovery and in the Atom toolbar)
and/or provide them if they're requested by URL.

It turns out that when you have a fair amount of content in a DWiki
your VirtualDirs and thus your AtomFeeds proliferate like over-active
rabbits. Then SyndicationDiscovery kicks in so that anyone who looks at
a virtual directory can discover its Atom feed and either start polling
it or just crawl it. Once your DWiki gets big enough this becomes not
really a good thing, as Chris has found out with his techblog.

This is implemented with the new _atomfeed-virt-only-adv_ and
_atomfeed-virt-only-in_ configuration file directives, documented in
[[../ConfigurationFile]]. This affects only the Atom page feed; the Atom
comment feed handling is unchanged.

Virtual dirs that have advertisement disabled actually advertise
the feed URL of the real directory instead (instead of omitting it
entirely). This seems to be sensible behavior and is probably what
real blog engines do.

A disallowed Atom request for a *range* or *latest* virtual dir returns
a redirection to the real directory's Atom feed. Partly this is because
it's justifiable and sensible behavior (the real feed is pretty close to
those things) and partly because there appear to be real people pulling
such feeds from ChrisSiebenmann's main DWiki instance. Other disallowed
Atom feeds are treated as if they didn't exist, generating 404 'no such
page' errors. This too makes sense since the real directory's feed is
not really anything like the feed for, say, last year.

You should not normally disable Atom feeds for the *latest* virtual
dir, since they have a sensible use in pulling a smaller than normal
feed from DWiki. For example, using '_dir/latest/10/?atom_' instead of
'_dir/?atom_' will get you a feed with only ten items in it. Atom feeds
of other virtual dirs make somewhat less sense, especially feeds from
things that are unlikely to change (such as past years or past months).

(In the future DWiki may allow feeds of current calendar things but not
past calendar things.)
