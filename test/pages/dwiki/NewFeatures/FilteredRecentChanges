The _RecentChanges_ DWikiText macro now accepts additional arguments
that are the list of directories to restrict the listing to, or with a
dash at the front, directories to exclude from the listing. If you
combine both, both criteria must match: in an included directory and
not excluded.

This lets a RecentChanges listing exclude areas that churn too much or
are otherwise less interesting to list. (Perhaps, for example, a blog
sub-hierarchy in a DWiki.)

If there is a common directory prefix that scanning is limited to, the
scan is efficient: only that directory and lower is looked at at all.
