DWiki now supports generating links to URLs on the wiki's web server
that are outside the DWiki itself. These are written as links in the
format _<...>_ and have to happen inside _![[...]]_. For example:
>  See [[the root of this web server|</>]].
generates a link to the DWiki's web server's root, which is all but
certain to be outside the DWiki space if you're running DWiki as a
CGI-BIN.
