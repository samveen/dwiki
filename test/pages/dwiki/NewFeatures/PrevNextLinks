== New: Previous and Next links in pages in blog views

The more I have used DWiki for a blog, the more I've realized that I
want individual entries to be able to have Previous (entry) and Next
(entry) links. At first I resisted because this would require an
expensive filesystem walk on even individual page views, but I have
now given in and made the _blog::prevnext_ renderer, which will do
this if I want.

_blog::prevnext_ generates links directly to the pages, not to
_/range/N-N/_ virtual directories, because I think that works better.
(It would be less code the other way, but better links are worth the
code.)
