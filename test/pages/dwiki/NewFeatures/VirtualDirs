DWiki now supports 'virtual directories': directories that don't
really exist but instead serve to limit what's shown for a real
directory. For example, you can limit what's shown for a real
directory to only the most recent 5 things, or to only things written
on 2005/05/29.

This is expected to be most useful when applied to a _blogdir_ view.

Virtual directories are added on to the end of a directory, and are
themselves treated as directories. The three types that currently
exist are:
* *calendar*: with the format ((<year>/[<month>/[<day>]])), all as
  digits; show just things from the specified time period. For
  example, [[../29thNewFeatures]] (which redirects to such a thing).
* *latest*: with the format ((latest/<howmany>)), shows the most
  recent <howmany> items.
* *range*: with the format ((range/<start>-<end>)) shows the most
  recent entries from the start'th to the end'th.

DWiki also lacks any direct support for generating links to virtual
directories, although you can use REDIRECT files to point to them.

This approach is essentially an alternate way of supplying additional
arguments to existing views, instead of creating alternate views for
the virtual directories. I think this is the appropriate take on the
whole thing for DWiki.

There is somewhat lame support for navigating backwards and forwards
through the limits. Usefully, breadcrumbs do a lot of the work for the
calendar based thing, although you cannot drill *down* from year to
month or month to day. In the future there will be some sort of
calendar block or strip or something. I am enamoured of a simple strip
of days with content or something, although that would have to be a
view all of its own.
