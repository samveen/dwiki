== New: https:// now supported in plain text

As part of fixing Atom feeds to not break embedded https:// urls, I
decided that we should support plaintext https:// URLs, like say
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/.

DWiki should now support non-HTTP URLs much better in general (before,
there were a number of problems and issued). You can even include
mailto: links if you really want to.
