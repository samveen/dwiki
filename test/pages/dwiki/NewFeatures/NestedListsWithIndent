The primary way of getting nested lists is now to indent the nested
list entries relative to the parent list (entry). This looks visually
better in plain ASCII for cases when there is a decent amount of text.

Although ChrisSiebenmann thought he wasn't going to, the old style of
nesting lists (multiple list start characters, eg ((***))) still
works. It turns out the GNU Emacs will properly autoindent for these
lists but not for *real* indented lists, plus sometimes they actually
look visually better.

The amount of old-style nesting is ignored in an indented context;
it's treated as just a new level.
