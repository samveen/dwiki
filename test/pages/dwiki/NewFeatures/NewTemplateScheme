DWiki has a new template handling scheme: the core idea is that we now
have a way of a) picking the first existing template from a list of
them and b) generating candidate templates by variable substitution
and 'all parent directories' expansion. This gives DWiki a simple and
general framework for doing things like 'template injection', which
lets us skin an entire directory hierarchy (but not the entire wiki)
with things like blog sidebars.

This also gives us a single top-level template that generates all
normal HTML-based pages, thereby giving us a single place to skin the
entire site. The per-view templates in ((views/*)) (now only a
convention) now just generate view-specific information, leaving all
of the rest up to the top-level template.

The clarity and lack of stupid template piece duplication of the
result is a clear indication of how it is a better scheme. (And no
more silly things like splitting a <div> start and end into different
files and hoping they get included in the right spots.)

[[../TemplateSyntax]] and [[../TemplatesUsed]] have been revised
appropriately.
