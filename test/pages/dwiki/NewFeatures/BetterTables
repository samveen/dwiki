DWiki's tables can now have rows that span multiple lines, using
indentation to continue them on subsequent lines just like with
lists. The appearance is straightforward; just write:
>  | start your table | another cell that
>    is continued on another line | the end cell |
>  | cell one | cell two | cell three |

A row is closed by having a '_ |_' at the end of a line, or just by
starting a new row.

An example:
| _root_	| If present, this is taken as the root directory that
		  further configuration directives can specify paths
		  relative to. |
| _pagedir_	| The root directory of the page hierarchy. |
| _tmpldir_	| The root directory of the template hierarchy.
| _rooturl_	| The URL of the root of the DWiki page hierarchy,
		  specified without the trailing _/_.

As you can see, because DWiki is obsessive the final '_ |_' on a line
is optional; if you omit it and go on, DWiki will just slam the whole
stack of open markup closed.

Cell contents are aligned to the top left of the cell, because this
seems to be about right for visual appearance for things that
ChrisSiebenmann wants.

The sole problem with this table markup style is that GNU Emacs wants
to put a starting ' |' on things when it autoindents, and won't
autoindent on subsequent lines. Unfortunately I don't think I can find
a visually appealing character that GNU Emacs will do the right thing
with.
