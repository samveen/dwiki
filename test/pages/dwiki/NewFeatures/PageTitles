== New: Page Titles

Pages now have accessible 'titles', sort of. A page's title is taken
to be the value of the header that starts the page, if said header is
on the very first line. (So this page's nominal title is 'New: Page
Titles'.) The header level doesn't matter; a _<h6>_ is as good as a
_<h1>_, so long as it's the first line on the page.

This info is available only after the page has been rendered, in the
new global context variable _:wikitext:title_. Fortunately for us,
Atom feed entries can have their fields in any order, so we are free
to generate _<title>_ after _<content>_.

Why did I do this? First, it's suitably low rent, and second I decided
I wanted some vague way to generate semi-real page titles in Atom
feeds instead of the current full path to the page (ever so helpful
and informative as it is).

The only tricky bit was making sure that only the appropriate magic
wikitext renderers set the page title, and not all the times that we
spin through wikitext looking for, eg, permissions. (Especially
important in Atom feeds, as Atom feeds look at everyone's permissions
before they do the real rendering.)
