DWiki can now generate RSS 2.0 format syndication feeds for recently
changed pages. This is a terrible hack that should not exist but
ChrisSiebenmann has to deal with a few things that don't accept Atom
format feeds, only RSS 2.0 feeds.
RSS 2.0 page feeds are just like Atom page feeds and all Atom page feed
restrictions and configuration options apply to them too. They are not
advertised anywhere (either in page tools or in feed automdiscovery);
to get access to them you must specify the feed URL directly, using the
view name '_rss2_' (as in !http://you.cim/dwiki/?rss2).

See _dwiki/view-rss2.tmpl_ and _syndication/rss2entry.tmpl_ for what
RSS 2.0 elements are used and how.

There is no RSS 2.0 feed for page comments.

(Because this is a hack, asking for the RSS 2.0 feed of VirtualDirs
that are restricted such that they get redirections to the base
directory, per AtomFeedsAndVirtualDirs, will get you a redirection
to the *Atom* feed for that base directory. This is considered
acceptable since people aren't supposed to be using those feeds
anyways.)
