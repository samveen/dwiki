== New: linktocomments renderer

This is a little new renderer that creates a link to a page in the
view necessary to show comments. In turn, this has caused the 'your
comment has been posted' template page to be tarted up so that it
uses it, thereby letting people who have posted comments see them in
the page they go to.

(I have decided not to have it link to the comment section of the
page, just on general principle. I may change my mind about this.)
