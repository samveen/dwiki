DWiki now lets you use spaces to separate things in _![[....]]_ links
instead of _|_. If you do this, the last word is taken as the link
URL or page, and the rest are the link name. (_|_ has priority over
this; DWiki tries space-separation only if there is no _|_.)

Thus (([[Google Rules The Web http://www.google.com/]])) turns into
[[Google Rules The Web http://www.google.com/]].

You can use either side as an abbeviation later, for example:
[[|http://www.google.com/]], [[Google Rules The Web|]]. (See View
Source.)

LinkAbbrevs done this way don't have to use _|_, as long as there is a
space in the value: (([[Google Rules The Web]])) still turns into
[[Google Rules The Web]].

This allows somewhat more aesthetic long link name things.

Note that the opening _![[_ and the closing _]]_ have to be on the
same line in the wikitext.
