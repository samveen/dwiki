DWiki now has an extremely low-rent generic from-the-web search
functionality. It's so low-rent I'm not sure I'm going to keep it, but
we'll have to see.
{{CutShort}}

Instead of doing something clever, it is basically the code that
implements !{{ListRefs:...}} ripped out. (ListRefs now calls the code,
so I do not go mad.)

It exists mostly because I didn't feel like grepping the page store
to see where I had mentioned something. So.

Because I am dubious about it, search must be enabled in the
configuration file with 'search-on'. Possibly this should be a
feature. 'search-on' can be set to _authenticated_, in which case
searching is restricted to authenticated users.

At least I now have the chance to put smarter searching code in one
place and I might even say I have a motivation to do that. Not *much*
of a motivation, but ...

In the process I got irritated at HTTP (again) and discovered more
things about CSS layout and objects. Today's hint: put all of the text
that you want to stay with the form in a single line *inside* the
<form> block, or 'lo, the browser will rearrange it.

I do still really wish forms could generate URLs with query suffixes
like '((?search&searchfor=whatever))'; that would have made my life
simpler and the URLs less ugly. (I could intuit a view from the
presence of _searchfor_ alone, but that is too much black magic right
now and I prefer not to guess too much when dealing with web input.)

DWiki is an odd combination of deep paranoia and gleeful flowers of
uncaring about such semi-security things.
