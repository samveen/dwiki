== New: DWikiText has 'processing notes' (and better quoting)

These are directives that change how DWikiText is interpreted to do
things like turn off certain font characters or map a simple-to-type
character sequence like '->' to a HTML entity. They are documented
in DWikiText so I am not going to repeat myself here.

In the process I added a new and less annoying plain quoting
mechanism: !``...''. It looks better in ASCII than it probably
does in the font here.

(The code for this was written in August of 2007 or so, but I sat
on it because I wasn't entirely sure I liked the feature. Well, nuts
to that; time to roll things out and just go.)
