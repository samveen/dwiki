If !{{RecentChanges}} is invoked in a !{{Striped:...}} context, it now
names the links to the pages by the name of the page instead of the
page's full path.  This turns out to be much less annoying if many (or
even some) of the changes are deep in a hierarchy.

Rational: you asked for a compact display so you're going to get it.
