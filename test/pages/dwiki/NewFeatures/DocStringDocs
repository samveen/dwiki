All wikitext macros and template renderer functions now have Python
docstrings. This is because there is a new macro, !{{DocAll}}, that
spits out a list of macros or renderers and their docstrings, thereby
creating a one-stop shop for a list of them all and documentation for
them.

[[../Formatting]] and [[../TemplateSyntax]] have been changed to use
this, thereby killing several birds and a fix-me with one somewhat
extended stone.

In the process of writing docstrings, I fixed several irritating
limitations and renamed a few renderers.

ChrisSiebenmann likes this approach best because it keeps the
documentation closely attached to the function, thereby serving as a
clear visual reminder that a) change the function, update the
documentation that's right there in front of him and b) write a new
function, write a docstring to go with it.
