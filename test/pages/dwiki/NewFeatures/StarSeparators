DWiki has a new formatting feature. If you write just '[[* * *|]]' on a
line by themselves, they center and become a separator. Like, well,
this:

*			 *			 *

You can't indent them, because I decided that would run too much risk
of confusing things with pre-formatted text blocks.

Why? I just decided I liked that style of chunk separator. (Maybe if I
could get a <hr> variant that didn't stretch the entire width...)

Note: feature subject to me changing my mind.
