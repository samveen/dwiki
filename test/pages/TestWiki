= This is just a test.

If there was actual contents, I would have written something here.
Something better.

However, let's show you the recent changes (most recent first):
* {{Striped:RecentChanges:10}}.

Recently commented on pages (see also [[|Manage/RecentComments]]):
* {{Striped:RecentCommentedPages:10}}
Recent comments: {{Striped:RecentComments:10}}.

See [[help/Help]] for help on working with [[DWiki|]]. \\
The most recent DWiki features are always at [[dwiki/NewFeatures]];
see also [[dwiki/Features]].

The recent changes list does not exclude redirection pages, since
it would otherwise have to *read* all the pages, not just walk the
entire wiki tree. Walking is presumed to be fast; loading content,
not so much.

(Revised: a limited-scope recent changes list does drop redirection
pages, because otherwise it is vaguely irritating. Since it examines a
finite and generally low number of pages, this is okay.)

To see all pages: Manage/AllPages

This is a DWiki.
